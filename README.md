Ignorify
========
This project is a personal tool that I built to generate gitignore files. It 
uses the snippets that are provided by GitHub. The snippets that are used to 
generate the actual gitignore files are stored in `~/.ignorify/snippets`. 


# Usage
There are several different ways to use this app. For some instructions use 
```
ignorify --help
```

To setup this tool, simply run: 
```
ignorify --init
```
This will clone the snippets directory down to the proper place in your home directory
and perform any other necessary setup tasks. After this init operation has been performed
you should be good to create ignore files as described below.

To list the available snippets, use: 
```
ignorify --list
```

It is relatively trivial to be able to `grep` through this list to search 
for a particular snippet. For instance, 
```
ignorify --list | grep c++
```

To generate a gitignore file, simply type out the options that you would 
like to include in the ignore file: 
```
ignorify c++ windows linux macos vim emacs 
```

This will output that generated ignore file to stdout. To create the file 
use Unix command line redirection. I.e. 
```
ignorify c++ windows linux macos vim emacs > .gitignore
```

You can also use this to append new snippets to an existing ignore file: 
```
ignorify rust  >> .gitignore 
```
