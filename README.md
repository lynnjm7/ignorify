Ignorify
========
This is a personal tool that I built to generate gitignore files. It 
uses the snippets that are provided by GitHub. The snippets that are used to 
generate the actual gitignore files are stored in `~/.ignorify/snippets`. 

This project served two purposes, it let me build a utility that I've wanted 
for a while and it gave me a toy to play around with learning the Rust programming
language.

# Usage
There are several different ways to use this app. For some instructions use 
```
ignorify --help
```

## Setup
To setup this tool, simply run: 
```
ignorify --init
```
This will clone the snippets directory down to the proper place in your home directory
and perform any other necessary setup tasks. After this init operation has been performed
you should be good to create ignore files as described below.

## Listing available options
To list the available snippets, use: 
```
ignorify --list
```

It is relatively trivial to be able to `grep` through this list to search 
for a particular snippet. For instance, 
```
ignorify --list | grep c++
```

## Generating gitignore files
To generate a gitignore file, simply type out the options that you would 
like to include in the ignore file: 
```
ignorify c++ windows linux macos vim emacs 
```

This will output that generated ignore file to stdout. To create the file 
use Unix command line redirection. I.e. 
```
ignorify c++ windows linux macos vim emacs > .gitignore
```

You can also use this to append new snippets to an existing ignore file: 
```
ignorify rust  >> .gitignore 
```

# Disclaimer
I have tested and use this tool on Linux. I haven't tested it on any other operating 
system. However, I see no reason why it shouldn't work and porting it should be relatively
straightforward for the sufficiently tenacious code monkey... But I do not currently have any plans 
on porting this tool to any other operating system.
